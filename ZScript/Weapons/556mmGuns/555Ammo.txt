//Basically 5.56 NATO, even though 5.56 NATO actually exists in the lore
/*
From the ZM66 section from the manual.

The basic infantryman's weapon of the 32nd century. 
A very lightweight select-fire weapon that fires up to 2100 rounds per minute, 
the Volt ZM66 represents the highest evolution of its state-of-the-art ammunition. 
As a refinement of the principles behind the old 5.56 NATO, the 4.26mm UAC 
Standard round packs an incredible amount of punch for its size. The 4.26mm 
UAC Standard round is protected by a special non-terminating legislative patent 
and a 99-year automatically renewed confidential exclusive contract with the militaries 
of all developed Western nations listed in the federal Officially Freedom-Loving Foreign 
Countries Trade Partnership Protocols, guaranteeing a safe and reliable supply.

As a refinement of the principles behind the old 5.56 NATO, the 4.26mm UAC 
(just replace 5.56 NATO with 5.55 UNATCO, and it's good.)
